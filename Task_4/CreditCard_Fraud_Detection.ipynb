    "## Objective:\n",
    "- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models while handling class imbalance effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset:\n",
    "The Kaggle Credit Card Transactions dataset, which contains transactions labeled as legitimate (0) or fraudulent (1). The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraud cases representing a small fraction of all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature-target separation and optional standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling missing values if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling Imbalance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Oversampling the minority class using SMOTE to generate synthetic fraud examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensures models learn patterns from both classes effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest (RF)\n",
    "\n",
    "- XGBoost (XGB)\n",
    "\n",
    "- LightGBM (LGBM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models are trained on the oversampled dataset and evaluated using classification metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Experiment Tracking:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MLflow is used to log parameters, metrics, and trained models for reproducibility and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trained models are saved and can be loaded later to predict fraud on new/unseen transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal:\n",
    "Develop robust, reproducible models for fraud detection, ensuring high recall on fraud cases while maintaining acceptable performance on legitimate transactions."
